abstract={User requirements are growing faster than ever and the limitations of the current mobile communication systems have forced the researchers to come up with more advanced and efficient technologies. 4G mobile technology is the next step in this direction. 4G is the next generation of wireless networks that will totally replace 3G networks. It is supposed to provide its customers with better speed and all IP based multimedia services. 4G is all about an integrated, global network that will be able to provide a comprehensive IP solution where voice, data and streamed multimedia can be given to users on an "Anytime, Anywhere" basis. At present we have many technologies each capable of performing functions like supporting voice traffic using voice over IP (VoIP), broadband data access in mobile environment etc., but there is a great need of deploying such technologies that can integrate all these systems into a single unified system. 4G presents a solution of this problem as it is all about seamlessly integrating the terminals, networks and applications. The race to implement 4G is accelerating as well as quite challenging. The aim of this paper is to highlight the benefits, challenges in deployment and scope of 4G technologies.},

abstract={In current and future wireless standards, such as WiMAX, 3GPP-LTE or LTE-Advanced, receiver terminals have to support numerous operating modes for each protocol [1], as well as sophisticated transmission techniques, especially enhanced MIMO detection and iterative forward error correction (FEC). MIMO detection and FEC belong to the most computationally complex parts of the receiver-side baseband signal processing chain. Implementations thereof must have low power consumption, but also be able to interact in a flexible and efficient way in the detection-decoding engine, while at the same time not compromising on the challenging throughput and flexibility requirements associated with 4G standards. In this paper, we present a chip implementation of a MIMO sphere detector combined with a flexible FEC engine, realizing a detection-decoding engine in silicon capable of satisfying 4G requirements with a data rate of 335Mb/s.},

abstract={This article provides an overview of the technology components and capabilities of the New Radio (NR) radio interface standard currently under development by 3GPP. NR will enable new use cases, requiring further enhanced data rates, latency, coverage, capacity, and reliability. This needs to be accomplished with improved network energy performance and the ability to exploit spectrum in very high frequency bands. Key technology components to reach these targets include flexible numerology, latency-optimized frame structure, massive MIMO, interworking between high and low frequency bands, and ultra-lean transmissions. Preliminary evaluations indicate that, with these technology components, NR can reach the 5G targets.},
